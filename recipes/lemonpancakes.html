        <li>Zest and juice from one lemon (about 1 tablespoon zest, 1/4 cup juice)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons (37g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup (140g) all-purpose flour, sifted</li>   
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>  
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>  
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>  
        <li>1 large egg</li> 
        <li>1 cup (240 ml) buttermilk</li>  
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li> 
        <li>2 tablespoons (30g) butter, melted</li> 
        <li>Canola oil/cooking spray , for coating the pan</li>     
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix lemon zest and sugar until well combined. Add flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix to combine, then set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate medium bowl, whisk together egg, buttermilk, melted butter, vanilla extract and lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the wet ingredients. Stir until combined and moistened. Be careful not to over mix.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or skillet over medium heat. Coat with cooking spray or oil. For each pancake, drop 1/4 cup of batter onto skillet. Cook 1-2 minutes, until surface of the pancakes have some bubbles. Flip carefully and cook another 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and cover loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm. Make sure to coat the skillet before every pancake or batch of pancakes to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately while pancakes are still warm. Drizzle with maple syrup or desired topping.</li>
